🌟 What is Smart Garbage Segregation?
An AI-powered waste sorting system that uses image classification to automatically identify and segregate waste into categories like plastic, paper, and metal.
Our mission: make recycling faster, smarter, and more sustainable.

💡 Why We Built This
🌍 The Problem

2.01 billion tons of waste generated annually

33% is not safely managed

8 million metric tons of plastic enter oceans yearly (enough to cover every shoreline with 5 grocery bags of plastic per foot)

🛠 The Solution

Automate waste sorting with AI + ML

Reduce human error and labor costs

Increase recycling rates & environmental sustainability

🛠 Tech Stack
Category	Tools & Tech
Frameworks	TensorFlow, Intel oneAPI, oneDNN
Languages	Python
Deployment	Streamlit
Core Concepts	CNNs, Image Classification, Real-Time Processing

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ Capture Image → Waste image taken via camera
2️⃣ Process → Preprocessing & resizing
3️⃣ Classify → CNN model predicts category
4️⃣ Sort → Directs waste to correct bin

📈 Continuous Learning – Model improves with each new dataset.

🌱 Impact
♻ Better Recycling – More recoverable materials

👷 Less Manual Labor – Safer, faster sorting

🏭 Industry-Ready – Can integrate with existing recycling lines

📚 Awareness – Educates public on proper waste management

🏆 What We Learned
Optimizing deep learning models with Intel oneDNN

Handling real-world image noise in classification

Deploying interactive AI apps with Streamlit

Designing scalable AI pipelines
