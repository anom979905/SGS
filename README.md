About the Project
<div align="center"> <img src="images/SmartGarbage.gif" alt="Smart Garbage Segregation Demo" width="750"> </div>
This project applies machine learning to automatically classify and segregate waste into categories like plastic, paper, and metal.
The system is trained using a large dataset of labeled waste images and uses a camera to capture new inputs for real-time classification.

✅ Why it matters:

Eliminates manual sorting — faster and more efficient

Reduces human error in waste management

Boosts recycling rates and recovery of reusable materials

Inspiration <img src="images/inspo.png" width="25">
Every year:

🌍 2.01 billion tons of municipal solid waste are generated

❌ 33% is not managed in an environmentally safe way

🌊 8 million metric tons of plastic enter oceans — that’s 5 plastic-filled grocery bags per foot of shoreline

The problem:
Manual garbage segregation is slow, labor-intensive, and often inaccurate.

Our solution:
Use AI + ML + Image Recognition to automate waste sorting, allowing:

Continuous improvement through machine learning

Faster, scalable processing for recycling plants

Lower environmental impact

Built With
Intel oneAPI & oneDNN – Hardware-optimized deep learning performance

TensorFlow – CNN-based image classification

Python + Jupyter – Data preparation & training

Streamlit – Interactive model deployment

How It Works
Capture waste images via camera.

Preprocess and feed them into a CNN classifier.

Model predicts the waste category (plastic, paper, metal, etc.).

The system updates accuracy over time through retraining.

Impact
♻ Environmental Sustainability – More recyclables recovered, less landfill waste

👷 Reduced Manual Labor – Workers handle less sorting, more supervision

🏭 Scalable for Industry – Fits into existing recycling workflows

📚 Educational Value – Promotes awareness of responsible disposal

What We Learned
Optimization with oneDNN improves both speed and efficiency

Building a robust CNN model for multi-class classification

Image preprocessing techniques for real-world conditions

Deployment of AI models for public interaction
